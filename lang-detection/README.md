# Language Detection Script

This script, lang.c, is a simple program that determines the language of the operating system. It provides information about whether the computer's operating system is set to French or not.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile the script, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o lang lang.c
```

To run the script, execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./lang
```

## Description

The `lang.c` script utilizes the `setlocale` function and system-specific APIs to determine the language of the operating system.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Sets the program's locale to the user's default locale.
2. Retrieves the current locale.
3. Checks if the locale contains "fr" (indicating French). If it does, it prints that the computer's operating system is set to French. Otherwise, it prints that the computer's operating system is not set to French.

## System-specific Implementation Details

Windows (Win32 API)
The Windows implementation utilizes the `Windows.h` header and the `GetSystemDefaultLangID` function to retrieve the primary language ID of the system. It then compares the primary language ID to the language ID for French (`LANG_FRENCH`) to determine if the system is set to French.

Unix/Linux
The Unix/Linux implementation uses the `getenv` function to retrieve the value of the `LANG` environment variable, which contains the primary language set for the system. It then checks if the value contains "fr" to determine if the system is set to French.

Note: The Unix/Linux implementation requires the script to be executed with appropriate privileges to access the LANG environment variable.
