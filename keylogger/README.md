# Keylogger Script

The `klog.c` script is a simple multi-platform keylogger written in C. It captures keyboard inputs and logs them into a file. The script supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Compilation and Usage

Windows
To compile the script on Windows, use the following command:

```bash
cl klog.c user32.lib
```

To run the compiled executable, use the following command:

```bash
klog.exe
```

Linux
To compile the script on Linux, make sure you have the ncurses library installed. Then, use the following command:

```bash
gcc klog.c -o klog -lncurses
```

To run the compiled executable, use the following command:

```bash
./klog
```

## Description

The `klog.c` script captures keyboard inputs and logs them into a file specified by the `PATH` macro. It uses different implementations for Windows and Linux operating systems.

Windows Implementation
The Windows implementation utilizes the `windows.h` and `conio.h` headers. The script opens the log file in append mode and continuously checks for key inputs using the `GetAsyncKeyState` function. When a key is pressed, the script logs the key's code into the file.

Linux Implementation
The Linux implementation uses the `ncurses` library for capturing key inputs. The script opens the log file in append mode and enters an infinite loop. It waits for a key press using the `getch` function from `ncurses` and logs the pressed key into the file.

## FTP Sender Function

The script includes a `sender` function that allows sending the log file to a server using FTP. The function uses the `libcurl` library for performing FTP uploads. You can customize the function to suit your needs, such as using a mail server or sockets for sending the file.
