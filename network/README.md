# Network Packet Sniffer

This script is a network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network packets. It can handle various protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and others. The captured packets can be used for network analysis and troubleshooting.

## Usage

To compile and run the network packet sniffer, follow these steps:

1. Compile the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc -o adv-sniffer adv-packet-sniffer.c && sudo ./adv-sniffer
   ```

2. The script requires root privileges to access the network interface and capture packets. Therefore, it needs to be run with `sudo`.

3. Once executed, the script will start capturing network packets and displaying information about them, including the protocol, source IP, destination IP, and more.

4. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the script and exit.

## Prerequisites

Before running the network packet sniffer, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `gcc`
- `stdlib.h`
- `string.h`
- `netinet/ip_icmp.h`
- `netinet/udp.h`
- `netinet/tcp.h`
- `netinet/ip.h`
- `sys/socket.h`
- `arpa/inet.h`

## Output
The script will generate an output file named log.txt. This file contains detailed information about the captured packets, including IP headers, TCP/UDP headers, and data payload.
